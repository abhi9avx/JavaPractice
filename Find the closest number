Given a sorted array arr[] of positive integers. The task is to find the closest value in the array to the given number k. The array may contain duplicate values.

Note: If the difference with k is the same for two values in the array return the greater value.

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 4
k = 4
arr[] = {1, 3, 6, 7}
Output: 
3
Explanation:
We have array arr={1, 3, 6, 7} and target is 4. If we look at the absolute difference of target with every element of the array we will get { |1-4|, |3-4|, |6-4|, |7-4| }  = {3, 1, 2, 3}. So, the closest number is 3.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 7
k = 4
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Output:
5
Explanation:
The absolute difference of 4 is 1 from both 3 and 5. According to the question, we have to return greater value, which is 5.
Your Task:
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function findClosest() that takes integers n and k and sorted array arr[] of size n as input parameters and return the closest number in the array to k. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(n)).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 106
1 ≤ k ≤ 109
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109
