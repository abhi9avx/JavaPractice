Explanation: Just decrement the numbers
by 1.
Your Task: 
Write the code to decrement each element of the array by 1 and return the array. The driver code will print the output.

............

public static int[] decrementArrayElements(int[] numbers){
    
    
    //Write your code here
    
    for(int i = 0 ; i< numbers.length;i++){
       numbers[i]= numbers[i]-1;
    }
    return numbers;
