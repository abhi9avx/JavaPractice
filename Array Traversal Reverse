You are given an array that contains integers. You need to print the elements of the array with in reverse order with a space between them.

Example 1:

Input:
numbers = [54, 43, 2, 1, 5]
Output: 
5 1 2 43 54
Explanation: Just traverse in reverse
and print the numbers.
Example 2:

Input:
numbers = [324, 5, 2, 2]
Output:
2 2 5 324
Explanation: Just traverse in reverse
xand print the numbers.
Your Task: 
Write the traversal code to print the elements of the array in reverse order. The list is provided as the parameter to the function arrayTraversalReverse. Print the elements with a space between the elements and don't give a new line as it is already provided by the driver code.



..........

public static void arrayTraversalReverse(int[] numbers){
    //Write your code below
    for(int i = numbers.length-1; i >= 0; i--){
        System.out.print(numbers[i] + " ");
    }

.........

void arrayTraversalReverse(int numbers[], int size){
    //Write your code below
    int start = 0 ;
    int end  = size -1;
    
    while (start<end){
        int temp = numbers[start];
        numbers[start] = numbers[end];
        numbers[end]=temp;
        
        start++;
        end --;
    }
    
    for(int i = 0 ; i<size;i++){
        System.out.print(numbers[i] + " ");
    }
