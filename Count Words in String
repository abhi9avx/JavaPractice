You are given a string s consisting of multiple words. You need to count the total words in the string. Words are separated by a single space.
Note: It is guaranteed that the last character of the given string is not a white space.

Example 1:

Input:
s = Geeks

Output: 
1
Example 2:

Input:
s = World is hello

Output: 
3
Your Task:

You only need to complet the function countWords() that takes s as parameter and returns the count of words in the string. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

........


class Solution
{
    // Complete the function
    // str: input string
    public static int countWords(String str)
    {
        // find and return the number of words 
        // present in the string
        int count = str.split("\\s").length;
        return count;
    }
}
