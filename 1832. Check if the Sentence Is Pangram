class Solution {
    public boolean checkIfPangram(String sentence) {
        // Create a set to store unique characters
        Set<Character> uniqueChars = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Iterate through each character in the sentence
        for (char ch : sentence.toCharArray()) {
            // Add the lowercase version of the character to the set if it is an alphabet character
            if (Character.isLetter(ch)) {
                uniqueChars.add(Character.toLowerCase(ch));
            }
        }

        return uniqueChars.size() == 26;
