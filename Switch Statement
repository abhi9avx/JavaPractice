Given a number, you have to use switch statement to print "One" (without quotes) if the given number is equal to 1 else print "Not One"(without quotes).

Example 1:

Input:
number = 10
Output: 
Not One
Example 2:

Input:
number = 1
Output:
One

Your Task: 
Just write a switch statement at the mentioned place that prints "One" if the given number is equal to 1 else prints "Not One".



..........

    //write your code here
    switch(number){
    case 1: 
        System.out.println("One");
        break;
    default: 
        System.out.println("Not One");
}
    
}
